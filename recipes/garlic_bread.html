        <h2> Easy roasted garlic bread made with roasted garlic, butter, and Parmesan cheese.</h2>
        <p>Do you like garlic bread?</p>
        <p>What a silly question. Of course you do. Why else would you be here in my domain of buttered bread?</p>
        <p>Let me show you to Garlic Wonderland.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 heads garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Slice the tops off of garlic heads, so the tip of each clove is exposed. Place garlic heads, cut-sides up, on a baking sheet; drizzle tops with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Set the oven to broil.</li>
            <li>Slice bread loaf in half horizontally; place cut-side up on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Squeeze garlic cloves from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, and parsley until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of bread.</li>
            <li>Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
